		<h2>To Recruiters</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Elsanussi Mneina. I make software, and I study linguistics. This page is designed to allow you to see a quick list of the projects I work on. The source code for these projects are hosted on GitHub. I host my source code online on GitHub because it allows people to partially judge my programming skill level, knowledge, and interests in the most convenient way. If you need to contact me please go to my LinkedIn account at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elsanussi-s-mneina/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/elsanussi-s-mneina/</a>.</p>
		<h2>Introduction to this page</h2>
		<p>This is a crafted summary of my activity on GitHub. It is intended to be a way for people to see all the projects I worked on to a significant extent, or started. The reason I felt this page is necessary is that I felt that the way GitHub shows a list of repositories is not suitable for people who are not programmers. Specifically that it shows forked projects in the same place as other projects.</p>
		<p>The main target audience of this document are people involved in hiring computer programmers, and people who want to use my software. These people are not neccessarily programmers.</p>
		<h2>Projects Created by Elsanussi Mneina</h2>
			<h3>Arabic (PC) Virtual Keyboard</h3>
			<p>This is a way to type using a keyboard layout for typing Arabic that is not usually available on public computers in North America. The Arabic (PC) layout is a very popular keyboard layout for typing Arabic on Windows. I made this project because sometimes people need to type Arabic, and don't have the permisson or time to install another keyboard layout on a public computer.</p>
